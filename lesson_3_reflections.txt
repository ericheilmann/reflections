When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you want to share your files with other team members for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Files could be in work by different team members, and you would only want to 
    pull files when they are ready for review/integration. Otherwise you may be
    pulling work in progress that is not complete.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch allows you to make changes in a repository without affecting the main line code. Use this to make experimental changes to your code.
    Clones allow you to make a copy of the entire repository. This will allow you to create a new version without affecting the old version.
    Forks allow you to copy the entire repository on Github. This allows you to make a new version without affecting the old version, and allows you to work on a copy of a repository that you may not have permission to edit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
